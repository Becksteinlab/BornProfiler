=========
 INSTALL
=========

Installing ``draw_membrane2a`` should be straightforward.


Compile manually
================

In almost all cases you should be able to just compile with the native
C-compiler and link against the math library libm and zlib::

  cc draw_membrane2a.c -o draw_membrane2a -lm -lz

Then copy the resulting binary to a directory on your PATH or, if you
prefer to have it hidden somewhere, enter the full path into the
BornProfiler configuration file, ``~/.bornprofiler.cfg``.


cmake
=====

A funky way to do the same thing is to use ``cmake`` http://www.cmake.org/::

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME ../src/drawmembrane
  make 
  make install

You can also set variables interactively:

  mkdir build && cd build
  ccmake ../src/drawmembrane

Press 'c' for 'configure', edit values, press 'c' then 'g' (or see
documentation for ccmake.)
