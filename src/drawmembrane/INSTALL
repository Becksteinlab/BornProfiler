=========
 INSTALL
=========

Installing ``draw_membrane2a`` should be straightforward.


Compile manually
================

In almost all cases you should be able to just compile with the native
C-compiler and link against the math library libm and zlib::

  cc draw_membrane2a.c -o draw_membrane2a -lm -lz

Then copy the resulting binary to a directory on your PATH or, if you
prefer to have it hidden somewhere, enter the full path into the
BornProfiler configuration file, ``~/.bornprofiler.cfg``.


cmake
=====

A funky way to do the same thing is to use ``cmake``::

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/bin -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src/drawmembrane
  make 
  make install
