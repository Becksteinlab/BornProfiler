 INSTALL BornProfiler
======================

.. Warning: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. By using it you acknowledge that
   you understand that it can potentially produce wrong results,
   delete files, drink your beer from the fridge, and post an
   embarassing picture of you on Facebook. Thanks for all feedback.

Required pre-requisites
=======================

* python2.5 or better
* NumPy http://numpy.scipy.org
* a C compiler such as GNU gcc
* APBS 


Installation
============

Get the source from Oli's repository (within SBCB) or unpack the tar
ball.

Install the python module and scripts::

  cd BornProfile
  python setup.py install --user

(``--user`` might only work for Python 2.6; look at the output of
``python setup.py install --help`` for guidance on what your options
are.)

Compile the customized (and improved) version of draw_membrane::

  mkdir BUILD && cd BUILD
  cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src/drawmembrane
  make
  make install

The ``make install`` step will install the executable
``draw_membrane2a`` under ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin``; change
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` if you prefer another location.

(cmake is not really needed; if you don't have it try the following::

   gcc ./src/drawmembrane/draw_membrane2a.c -o draw_membrane2a -lm -lz

and install manually in a place where you or your shell can find it.)


Configuration
=============

Finalize your installation by running ::

  apbs-bornprofile-init.py

This should tell you that it set up a configuration file
``~/.bornprofiler.cfg`` and a number of directories.

The default ``~/.bornprofiler.cfg`` looks like this::

   [DEFAULT]
   configdir = ~/.bornprofiler
   templatesdir = %(configdir)s/templates
   qscriptdir = %(configdir)s/qscripts

   [executables]
   apbs = apbs
   drawmembrane = draw_membrane2a

The file can be edited in a text editor. For instance, one can add the
full path to the ``apbs`` and ``draw_membrane2a`` executable binaries.

Any other variables used in run configuration input files can also be
added here and will be used as defaults.

Advanced use: You can drop templates for run scripts into *qscriptdir*
and have the BornProfiler package pick them up automagically.
