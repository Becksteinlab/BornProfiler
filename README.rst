 README for BornProfiler
=========================

A small Python package to set up "Born" calculations of an ion in a
membrane protein and calculate the electrostatic free energy with
APBS_.

.. _APBS: http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/apbs

.. Warning:: This software is under development and should not be
             relied upon yet. Feedback in the form of bug reports and
             pull requests is welcome.


Features
========

The *BornProfiler* package helps setting up Poisson-Boltzmann
calculations of the electrostatic potential of mean force of an ion in
a pore or channel under the influence of a membrane. The membrane is
modelled as a dielectric slab of Îµ=2.

 * Provide a path (list of coordinates) and a PQR file of the protein as input.
 * A membrane can be defined with arbitrary thickness, z-position, and
   dielectric. A headgroup region can also be defined with a different
   dielectric constant. 
 * Define all input parameters in a compact parameter file so that
   there is always a record of the exact calculation setup available. 
 * Born radii for all ions from the Rashin & Honig paper [Rashin1985]_
   are included; just select the ion in the input file.
 * Born radii for H3O+, OH- (and H+... for testing) have been derived
   from the solvation free energies in [Pliego2000]_ directly via the
   Born equation. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
 * Customize run scripts and queuing system submission scripts by
   providing your own templates.

History and Contributions
=========================

Based on Kaihsu Tai's Python rewrite (`Poisson-Boltzmann profile for
an ion channel`_) of the original ``placeion.sh`` and ``analyze.sh``
bash scripts by Kaihsu Tai and Oliver Beckstein.

Uses material from the APBS Wiki (`PMF of a helix in a membrane`_) and
contains a modified version of Michael Grabe's ``draw_membrane2`` from
APBSmem_.

See the file AUTHORS for all contributors.
